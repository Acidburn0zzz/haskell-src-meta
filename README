haskell-src-meta is a package originally by Matt Morrow for converting a
parsed AST from haskell-src-exts to a TH AST for use in splices and
quasiquoters. The last version Matt released before he disappeared from
the Haskell community was 0.0.6, but by that time his library was
already popular, so some community members eventually decided to take
over maintenance of the package, keeping it up to date with the latest
versions of TH etc.

I don't really view this as "my" package so if you want write access to
the github repository, or you think you could do a better job as
maintainer, just ask.

Major changes:

0.4.0.1 -> 0.4.0.2:

- Fixes/additions to inline pragma support (Jonas Duregard)
- Compatibility with GHC 7 and TH 2.5 - totalling three major versions!
- Move some of the quasiquoters to their own package, and stop exporting
  the rest (they are kept as examples of usage)
